# Release Notes

## v1.4.0

### Changes
- **Auto Server Discovery**: Extension auto-detects server type, capabilities, and WebSocket endpoint from a single HTTP URL via `/api/browser/config`
- **Unified Server URL**: Single `SERVER_URL` replaces separate `WEBSOCKET_SERVER_URL` and `HTTP_SERVER_URL` — WebSocket address is auto-discovered
- **Adaptive Authentication**: Auth flow is now message-driven, reacting to server's first message instead of guessing with a timeout
- **Multi-server Support**: Full support for both lightweight (`js-eyes/server`) and full-featured (`deepseek-cowork`) server backends
- **Built-in Server**: New lightweight Node.js server (`server/`) with HTTP + WebSocket on a single port, browser client management, and tab tracking
- **Server Type Display**: Popup UI now shows detected server name/version and supported capabilities
- **Tolerant Health Check**: `HealthChecker` accepts HTTP 503 as valid "critical" response, supports multiple response formats
- **CLI Toolchain**: New `cli/` module with build, bump, commit, sync, and release commands (cross-platform, i18n support)
- **Landing Page**: New project site built from `src/` to `docs/` with i18n support
- **Test Suite**: Added unit tests for server WebSocket handler and Firefox extension utilities
- **Bug Fixes**: Fixed SSE false activation, health check 503 handling, and port mismatch issues
